# Pacman Simulation Model

This project is a simulation of the Pacman game made using the NetLogo modeling language. It is a simplified reproduction of the famous arcade game where the player controls a yellow character(Pacman) who must eat dots while avoiding ghosts.

## How to Run the Simulation

1. Make sure you have NetLogo installed on your system. You can download it from [the official NetLogo website](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml).
2. Download the project files and open the `IAD_project.nlogo` file in NetLogo.
3. In NetLogo, click the "Setup" button to initialize the simulation.
4. Click the "Go" button to start the simulation.
5. Use the arrow keys to move Pacman and avoid the ghosts.
6. The game ends when Pacman runs out of lives or has eaten all the dots.

## Main Features

- A player-controllable Pacman agent.
- Ghosts that chase Pacman.
- Dots scattered on the grid that Pacman must eat.
- A score that increases with each dot eaten.
- A display of the remaining lives.
- A game over message when Pacman loses all his lives.

## Adjustable Parameters

- The number of ghosts on the grid.
- The initial number of dots on the grid.
